Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a showcase of my skills as a web developer, specifically using HTML and CSS to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. 
I have designed and developed the entire site from scratch, paying attention to both the aesthetic and functional aspects.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For creating the structure of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the content and ensuring a modern, attractive design.
Responsive Web Design: Using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.


Feel free to explore the code and see how I structure my HTML and CSS for efficient, maintainable web development. If you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my process, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
